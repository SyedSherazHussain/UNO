# **Project Description**
The purpose of our project is to create an interactive game that primarily focuses on the concepts that were learnt in class and manipulating the functionalities of Python to design a complex yet efficient and easy to comprehend game, UNO.

UNO is one of the most famous and exciting classic card games for both the children (age:7+) and the adults.
It includes a deck 108 cards: four each of "Wild" and "Wild Draw Four," and 13 each of four different colors (red, yellow, green, blue). Each color consists of cards from 0      through 9, and one each of "Skip," "Draw Two," and "Reverse." These last three types are known as "action cards.“
To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, and a card from the remaining deck will be randomly selected and set aside to begin the play. The first turn will be decided randomly. On a player's turn, they must do one of the following:
play one card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol
play a Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card 
draw the top card from the deck, then play it if possible
The first player to play all of their cards wins the game.

# **Game Features**
  ## ⦿ REPLAYABILITY
  Choice to play again and again with a different gameplay each time thus keeping the player hooked to the game
  ## ⦿ GAMING ENVIRONMENT
  Action cards create an energizing environment bombarding the player with continuous challenges
  ## ⦿ WINNING CHANCES
  At the beginning of the game, both the player and computer have equal winning chances. Neither of them has an advantage over the other
  ## ⦿ LIMITING INACTIVITY PERIOD
  We will be designing a player vs computer game to keep the player riveted on to the game instead of a multi-player game - which can devastate the player's interest due to long periods of inactivity while waiting for their turns
  ## ⦿ CARD DEALING
  This is an added feature not found in the traditional UNO game. We have included this in the game to create a competitive environment and to increase the difficulty level of the game - If a player has no playable cards in his hand, then they can exchange an action card with the required colour card, from the PC and vice versa.
  ## ⦿ CHALLENGING WILD DRAW FOUR
  Another added feature - If a player wants, then they can challenge the other’s throw of Wild Draw 4 card. WILD DRAW FOUR can only be played when no valid card is available. If played otherwise and challenged, then as penalty 6 cards must be drawn from the deck.
 
# **Technical Architecture**
  A detailed architecture diagram for the project linking the various functions and modules to the main loop has been attached to this file.

# **How to deploy the program**
  To play the game:
  - You must have a python IDLE (game originally created on Visual Studio Code)
  - You must import the third party module 'colorama' to view coloured text; 
    We used Colorama to bring colors to the game, especially the starting UNO title, “Fore” command is used to color the characters of a line
    The rest of the games’ lines have also been colored to light cyan  to make the game look appealing.
  - Built-in modules 'time' and 'random' have been used in the program therefore, they must also be imported for code execution.
